# TextBasedGameGroupB

## CONCEPT KILLER

#### Goal 
  The goal of our group is to create an interactive user driven text based application. The application will be time driven, with actions 
occuring based on the current environment. Quick thinking during combat will keep the user on thier toes as they try to dodge, block, or parry and counter thier opponent. Each area will be randomly genrated so no play through will be unwillingly repeated. Will there be a loot box in the next area? Maybe, or there is a hideous creature that was alerted when you broke down the locked door! Every decision made by the user will affect the outcome and decisions they will have to make as they progress through the world. Try to survive in the wasteland the was once home, try not to starve, or die of thirst!
