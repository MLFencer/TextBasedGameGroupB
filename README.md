# TextBasedGameGroupB

## CONCEPT KILLER

#### Goal 
  The goal of our group is to create an interactive user driven text based application. The application will be time driven, with actions 
occuring based on the current environment. Quick thinking during combat will keep the user on thier toes as they try to dodge, block, or parry and counter thier opponent. Each area will be randomly genrated so no play through will be unwillingly repeated. Will there be a loot box in the next area? Maybe, or there is a hideous creature that was alerted when you broke down the locked door! Every decision made by the user will affect the outcome and decisions they will have to make as they progress through the world. Try to survive in the wasteland the was once home, try not to starve, or die of thirst!

### Done Sprint 1
  The definition of done for this sprint is when there is a user driven experience. The User should feel like they are in control of their actions and they are the reason for their success or death. The story should be layed out based on what the player does in the world. Every command should be viewable for the current situation they are in. They will be able to view their current inventory items as well as use items to aid their journey. The player will be able to move from one area to the next and search for items on the way. They will have to fight to stay alive and clear an area before searching for supplies or run to survive. Current health, level, name, and experience progress will be known by the player at all times. The player will be notified when events occur.
